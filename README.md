# Luggage Storage System Simulation

This C++ program is a luggage storage system simulation that enables users to interact with various types of luggage. The program leverages the power of polymorphism and inheritance, two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming, to create a highly adaptable and scalable design. With the simulation, users can effortlessly add, remove, and view different luggage items based on their specific attributes.
## Getting Started

To run the luggage storage system simulation, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.

2. Download or clone the `main.cpp` file to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `main.cpp` file is located.

4. Compile the C++ source code using the appropriate compiler command. For example:

   ```shell
   g++ main.cpp -o luggage_system
   ```

5. Run the compiled program by executing the command:

   ```shell
   ./luggage_system
   ```

6. Follow the instructions displayed on the screen to interact with the luggage storage system simulation.

## Usage

Once the luggage storage system simulation is running, you can use the following commands:

- `add` - Add a new luggage item to the storage system. You will be prompted to enter the type of luggage and its attributes.

- `remove` - Remove a luggage item from the storage system. You will be prompted to enter the unique identifier of the luggage item you want to remove.

- `show all` - View all luggage items currently stored in the system.

- `total volume` - Show the total volume of each luggage item.

- `exit` - Exit the simulation.

## Conclusion

The luggage storage system simulation provides a practical example of implementing polymorphism and inheritance in C++. It serves as a starting point for building more complex systems and can be customized and expanded to suit specific requirements. Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different scenarios, and enhance the simulation as needed.
